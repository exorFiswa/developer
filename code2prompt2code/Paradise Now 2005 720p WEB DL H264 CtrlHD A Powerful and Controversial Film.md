The film follows the last days of Said and Khaled, childhood friends who live in Nablus and have been recruited by an unidentified resistance group for a suicide mission in Tel Aviv.

However, things go wrong and they are separated, forcing them to face their own doubts and dilemmas.

Some of the critics who gave positive reviews include Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: \"Certainly what Said says will not come as a surprise to any Israeli. It's simply that they disagree.
