In this article, we will show you how to use Voice Trap to remove or isolate vocals from an audio track. We will use the example of a song called "Voice Trap ((NEW)) Crack Code For Kaspersky" by Tony Evans, which you can find on SoundCloud[^1^] [^2^]. You will need a VST host application that supports Voice Trap, such as Audacity, FL Studio, or Reaper.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Voice Trap
 
You can download Voice Trap from the official website of Clone Ensemble[^4^] [^5^]. The plugin costs $25 and you will need a serial number to activate it. After downloading the ZIP file, extract it and copy the VoiceTrap.dll file to your VST plugins folder. Then, launch your VST host application and scan for new plugins.
 
## Step 2: Load the Audio Track and Voice Trap
 
Open the audio track that you want to process with Voice Trap. In our example, we will use Audacity to load the song from SoundCloud. To do this, go to File > Open and paste the URL of the song in the File name box. Then, click Open.
 
Next, add Voice Trap as an effect to the audio track. In Audacity, go to Effect > Add / Remove Plug-ins and select Voice Trap from the list. Then, click Enable and OK.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the Parameters of Voice Trap
 
To remove or isolate vocals from an audio track, you need to adjust the parameters of Voice Trap according to your preference. The plugin has two modes: Vocal Removal and Vocal Isolation. You can switch between them by clicking on the buttons at the top of the plugin window.
 
The plugin also has several sliders that control different aspects of the processing. Here is a brief explanation of each slider:
 
- Bass Cutoff: This sets the frequency below which the bass frequencies are left untouched by the plugin. You can increase this value if you want to remove more bass from the output.
- Center Width: This sets the width of the center channel that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can increase this value if you want to remove more vocals from the output.
- Profile Phase: This sets the phase shift of the profile signal that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can adjust this value if you hear artifacts or phasing issues in the output.
- Track Low: This sets the lower frequency limit of the tracking filter that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can increase this value if you want to remove more low-frequency vocals from the output.
- Range: This sets the frequency range of the tracking filter that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can increase this value if you want to remove more vocals from a wider frequency range.
- Track Mode: This sets the mode of the tracking filter that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can choose between Fixed and Adaptive modes. Fixed mode uses a constant frequency range for the tracking filter, while Adaptive mode adjusts the frequency range according to the input signal.
- Track Node: This sets the position of the tracking filter node that is used for vocal removal or isolation. You can adjust this value if you hear artifacts or phasing issues in the output.

You can experiment with different values for each slider until you get the desired result. You can also use presets that are included with the plugin for different types of audio tracks.
 
## Step 4: Apply Voice Trap and Save the Output
 
Once you are satisfied with the settings of Voice Trap, you can apply it to your audio track. In Audacity, go to Effect > Voice Trap and click OK. The plugin will process your audio track and remove or isolate vocals according to your parameters.
 
You can then save your output as a new audio file. In Audacity, go to File > Export and choose your
